    RECITATION SECTION NUMBER: 02
    RECITATION INSTRUCTOR NAME: Yanan Yu
    COP 3014 - Summer 2009
    PROJECT NUMBER: 5
    DUE DATE: Monday 7/20/2009
    PLATFORM: Windows OS using Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2008 compiler

SUMMARY

This program initially opens up a file and then displays a menu to the user. 
This menu enables the user to choose between four options that either play
the songs in SongData.txt in a certain order or quit the progran.

INPUT

The input is entirely interactive.  It will only require the user to 
enter in the choice on the music player menu to pick the style of play 
desired.  All input is typed in at the keyboard by the user 
(person running the program). 

OUTPUT

All output goes to the text (console) window.  The program prints an output 
title and echoprints the user's input in a readable fashion.  A four option 
menu is printed out as well for the user to enter in a choice.

ASSUMPTIONS

We cannot assume that all input data is valid and correctly entered by the 
user.  Therefore, this program counteracts this problem by looping the file 
menu choice selection.  The menu opening loop tests for correct choice of the 
numbers 1-4.
